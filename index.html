        <p><strong style="font-size:120%">Software and Hardware Engineer</strong>
        <br>Computer Engineering 3rd year student at University of Dayton in Ohio, United States.
        <br><br>
        Currently employed as a Systems Engineer at a certain Fortune 500 corporation. Always eager to start a new engineering hobby project, whether it be in hardware or software design. I'm currently learning about <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDYYn9R-JyE" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;">the BETH web stack</a></u> and reverse engineering with <u><a href="https://ghidra-sre.org/">Ghidra</a></u>.
        <br><br>
        I intend to house future tech projects here. In the past, I've built projects to help communities grow and make complicated processes simple and automated.

            <u><a style="color:black;text-decoration:none;">jackengle.net Update (In Progress)</a></u>
            <br>Significant website upgrade, transitioning from a static GitHub Pages website to a full stack web application. Website planned to use Vue, TailwindCSS, PostgreSQL and Vercel, and will allow for more dynamic content to be stored and hosted right here.

            <u><a href="https://github.com/kayaked/esp32-ble-mouse-remote/" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;">PC Mouse Remote (August 2023)</a></u>
            <br>Device that functions like a wireless mouse, but has the form factor of a traditional TV remote. The purpose of this project was to give my family and friends, who frequently projected a laptop screen to our TV, a more user-friendly device for navigation. The device is built on the ESP32-WROOM-32E-N8 microcontroller (connects via Bluetooth) and runs custom software designed and tailored specifically for this remote. I designed the software, schematic, PCB and the case's model as my first solo endeavor in embedded systems.

            <u><a style="color:black;text-decoration:none;">Logic Design Keyboard / The Mach 1 (April-August 2023)</a></u>
            <br>PS/2 Keyboard designed using a series of discrete logic chips and an EEPROM. After learning about digital design and creating several Verilog projects on an FPGA breakout board, I wanted to use my knowledge to build something useful from the ground up. <!-- This keyboard design uses an 8x8 keyswitch matrix, cycling a high signal across all individual columns which, when a key is pressed, completes a circuit with its given row on the board. The rows are connected to Mealy-type positive edge-pulse converters then encoded to a valid 4-bit bus. An AT28C256 EEPROM receives the current row and column as parallel address inputs and is triggered by any row pulse, and its data output yields that 2D position's scan byte (keys with E0- scan codes are unsupported). The final stage involves a shift register system with up to 11 parallel inputs: one logic 0, 8 scan code data bits, one odd parity bit calculated using XOR logic, and one logic 1. Additional areas of the logic include negative edge triggering for switch breaking (requires 22 sent bits with F0- data prefix identifying release) and additional shift registers for sending a valid SPI clock (cycling during data transmission and high otherwise). --> The schematic design, verification, test engineering and assembly for this keyboard is a solo project.
            <!--A much simpler variant, the Mach 2, currently contains only one key, ideally being able to produce any response on a host computer in the shortest time possible. The inspiration for this variant stems from lots of PC games not requiring many keys to operate, thus reducing the need for most keys to be tracked by the keyboard at all.-->

            <u><a href="resistance/" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;">Resistor Color Band Conversion (March 2023)</a></u>
            <br>Simple tool I developed allowing a colored bands on a resistor to be easily input and converted to their reading in Ohms (Î©), and vice-versa. Site works with all band counts as well as temperature coefficients in ppm/K and tolerances in % error. The site also gives several sections full of important information about resistors, including their physical makeup and analysis techniques like voltage division. Optimized for scaled windows and mobile devices with further periodic updates on the way.

            <u><a href="hanoi/" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;">The Great Hanoi Rat Hunt (December 2022)</a></u>
            <br>Small pokemon-style video game based entirely around Michael Vann's <i>The Great Hanoi Rat Hunt</i> that I host and contributed heavily to. The game lasts for only 15 in-game days and is set in the French colonial-era city of Hanoi, Vietnam. Gameplay involves collecting rats and (more importantly) listening to historically relevant dialogue from both French and Vietnamese residents. There is too much historical context and backend to explain here, so read the book and play the game yourself!

            <u><a href="https://github.com/kayaked/jailbrush" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;">Jailbrush iOS Theme Creator (October 2019)</a></u>
            <br>Mainly used for legacy iOS devices, this tool allows simple iOS theme packages to be created for a respective jailbroken system. Made in Python and powered by PyQt 5, the goal of Jailbrush was to give a simple and versatile solution for packaging and installing a theme to an Apple mobile device. This project was inspired by my team's consistent issues with slow theme packaging, even when having experience doing so. The tool is capable of packaging a Debian archive with correct metadata/references and using SSH capabilities of the iOS device (usually OpenSSH or similar) to copy and install the theme package. This project is far from its maximum potential; the planned.txt file in the main repo gives major information about improvements.

            <u><a style="color:black;text-decoration:none;">Trackrr Bot (December 2018)</a></u>
            <br>Developed in Python, this bot was designed to serve information from over a dozen streaming services about songs, albums, artists, lyrics and more. The bot served its functionality mainly through Discord (as well as a very primitive web application) and searched music through Spotify, Apple Music, SoundCloud, Amazon Music, Deezer, Genius, Last.FM, Tidal, BandCamp, MusicBrainz and YouTube. The information was given to users on command with asynchronous tasks, allowing the bot to process several commands at once. Later, the project was made more generalized as its own API service for use by other developers. My role in this project was as a major early contributor to the version I described, and work was done in a small team led by <a href="https://github.com/ms7m" style="color:black;text-decoration:underline;">@ms7m</a>. I left the development team behind this concept in May of 2019, where other members were able to continue and expand on its concept.
